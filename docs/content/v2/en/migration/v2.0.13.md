With the change to version `2.0.13` there are the following changes:


## Hardware performance check removed

The hardware check for showing the `SpeedkitLayer` has been removed.

The `device` option and the use of the message (`#nuxt-speedkit-message-outdated-device`) in the SpeedkitLayer, are no longer valid and must be removed. 

Alternatively, it now waits for a free `idle` slot when initializing the JS,

- if a free slot is available, the JS is initialized
- if no free slot is available, the message `#nuxt-speedkit-message-performance-issue` is showed in the SpeedkitLayer.

The old message `#nuxt-speedkit-message-outdated-device` must be replaced by the new `#nuxt-speedkit-message-performance-issue`.

```html
<li id="nuxt-speedkit-message-outdated-device">
  outdated device
</li>
```

replaced with 

```html
<li id="nuxt-speedkit-message-performance-issue">
  performance issue
</li>
```

## SpeedkitLayer Button Interactions

Button `#nuxt-speedkit-button-init-font` has been replaced by `#nuxt-speedkit-button-init-performance-issue`.

`#nuxt-speedkit-button-init-performance-issue` does the following when clicked:

1. Sets the CSS class `nuxt-speedkit-performance-issue` on the `html` tag.
2. Activates all fonts by setting the class `font-active` on all elements with the attribute `data-font`.
3. Converts all not activated pictures (`:hydrate="false"`) from `noscript` to `picture`. 

<alert>The CSS class `nuxt-speedkit-performance-issue` is removed again at app initialization.</alert>
