With the change to version `2.0.13` there are the following changes:

## SpeedkitLayer

### Hardware performance check removed

The hardware check for showing the `SpeedkitLayer` has been removed.

The option `device` from module and the use of the message (`#nuxt-speedkit-message-outdated-device`) in the SpeedkitLayer, are no longer valid and must be removed.

Alternatively, it now waits for a free `idle` slot when initializing the JS,

- if a free slot is available, the JS is initialized
- if no free slot is available, the message `#nuxt-speedkit-message-weak-hardware` is showed in the SpeedkitLayer.

The old message `#nuxt-speedkit-message-outdated-device` must be replaced by the new `#nuxt-speedkit-message-weak-hardware`. ([See Messages](#messages))

### Messages

1. `outdated-device` to `weak-hardware`

    ```html
    <li id="nuxt-speedkit-message-outdated-device">
      outdated device
    </li>
    ```

    replaced with

    ```html
    <li id="nuxt-speedkit-message-weak-hardware">
      weak hardware
    </li>
    ```

2. `slow-connection` to `reduced-bandwidth`

    ```html
    <li id="nuxt-speedkit-message-slow-connection">
      slow-connection
    </li>
    ```

    replaced with

    ```html
    <li id="nuxt-speedkit-message-reduced-bandwidth">
      reduced-bandwidth
    </li>
    ```

### Button Interactions

Button `#nuxt-speedkit-button-init-font` has been replaced by `#nuxt-speedkit-button-init-reduced-view`.

`#nuxt-speedkit-button-init-reduced-view` does the following when clicked:

1. Sets the CSS class `nuxt-speedkit-reduced-view` on the `html` tag.
2. Activates all fonts by setting the class `font-active` on all elements with the attribute `data-font`.
3. Converts all not activated pictures (`:hydrate="false"`) from `noscript` to `picture`.

<alert>The CSS class `nuxt-speedkit-reduced-view` is removed again at app initialization.</alert>
